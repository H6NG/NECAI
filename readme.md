# `NECAI`
**`Neural-Enhanced Chess AI`**

A chess engine combining a C++ classical search with a PyTorch neural evaluator trained on Stockfish-labeled positions.

## How it plays

For each move the API runs:

1. **Hardcoded first move** — `1.e4` if NECAI is white from the starting position
2. **Opening book** — looks up the current PGN in a Lichess opening dataset; if matched, plays the book move
3. **Classical C++ engine** — negamax + alpha-beta + quiescence at depth 2
4. **Neural eval** — computed for the current position and shown in the UI as a second opinion (display only, not used for move selection)

The classical engine drives all decisions outside of book; the neural eval is informational.

## Classical search (C++)

- Negamax with alpha-beta pruning
- Move ordering: captures first
- Quiescence search at leaves (extends through captures, with checkmate/stalemate detection so a forced mate at the leaf is scored as `-99999` instead of a static eval)
- Static eval combines material, piece-square tables, pawn structure (doubled, isolated), king pawn shield, and mobility differential

```bash
./necai_engine "<fen>" <depth>
# → {"best_move": "e2e4", "engine_eval": 25, "game_over": false}
```

---

## Neural evaluator

### Training data
- Source: [Lichess chess-position-evaluations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lichess/chess-position-evaluations) (Stockfish evals at depth ≥ 18)
- ~50M positions, plus ~30K synthetic material-imbalance positions for grounding

### Model
- Input: `18 × 8 × 8` board planes + 8 scalar features (material diff, mobility, castling rights, en-passant, in-check, move counters, bishop-pair flags)
- Backbone: 6 residual blocks @ 128 channels
- Output: scalar in `[-1, 1]` (white's perspective, after `Tanh`)

### Targets
Stockfish centipawns are mapped to `[-1, 1]`:
```python
target = tanh(cp / 600)     # mate → ±1
```

### Training
- Loss: SmoothL1 (Huber)
- Optimizer: AdamW, LR 1e-3, weight decay 1e-4
- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor 0.5, patience 2)
- Early stop: 5 epochs without improvement

```bash
python -m evaluator.neural_eval.train          # stream from HuggingFace
python -m evaluator.neural_eval.train --from-disk
python -m evaluator.neural_eval.export_jit     # produce JIT model for fast inference
```

---

## Building

```bash
make                  # builds necai_engine
make top_moves        # builds optional candidate generator (used by hybrid_engine)
```

Python deps:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

API:
```bash
python api/app.py     # serves on :5001
```

---

## Decision pipeline (`api/app.py` → `/move`)

1. Validate the incoming FEN — return immediately on game-over
2. Hardcoded `1.e4` if NECAI is white from the start position
3. Opening book lookup against the current PGN
4. Classical C++ engine at depth 2 if no book match
5. Compute neural eval of the current position (display only)
6. Return chosen move + both evals to the UI

## Status

🚧 Active development.
- Classical search: functional, with quiescence checkmate detection in place
- Neural evaluator: trained but output was poorly calibrated (saturating at ±1); architecture now has a `Tanh` output layer and is being retrained
- Opening book: small (~3.6k named openings); coverage runs out by move 4–5
